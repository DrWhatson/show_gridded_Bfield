## Synopsis

This script produces an interactive 3D display of galactic B-field
models produced by GALPROP. It uses Mayavi to make the display. 

## Code Example

python show_gridded_Bfield.py --shape=(256,256,51) --hslice B_field_type10.bin

Will produce a mayavi window whch can be expanded and moved around by
dragging the mouse pointer through it.

## Motivation

This is part of the RADIOFOREGROUNDS Horizons 2020 project and
provided as part of the move to provide user tools to data products
which will generated by it.

## Installation

Mayavi needs to have been installed beforehand but on most linux
systems this can be achieved by a pip install.

$ pip install mayavi

## API Reference

Command line args:

    filename  : The B-field file is just a long stream of binary double 
                precision numbers with no formatting 

    --shape=nx,ny,nz :  

                The  the shape of the array must given via the 'shape' 
                command line option or it is assumed to be a default 
                (256,256,51)

    --hslice  : Whether or not to show a semi-tranparent horizontal slice 
                showing the B-field intensity

    --mask_points=100 :

                Too many points to show at once, so thin by <mask_points> factor
                default of 100 seems to work best

    scale_factor=3 : Scale size to apply to arrows. Default=3
